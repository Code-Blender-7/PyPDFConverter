# Beginnings

This is the first project that I am touching after the end of my examination.
Truly the year was unproductive as hell because of the load of studies that I had to undertake. But those are over now and I am open for projects. Hopefully I can complete some of my project ideas before the end of this year.


I decided to name this project as PyPDFConverter. I could like add a more cooler name like Ultimate-Py-PDF but that feels too much cringe to me.

# Goals

These are the addons goals of this project the moment that I am writing this;

### Main Features
1. Can convert JPG to PDF
2. Works on bulk.
3. Corrupted file scanner: Checking for damageed files before converting. (Can be disabled)


### Sub Features
1. Shows Progression of Convertion
2. Shows status of PDF
3. One-Way Convert: Delete JPG after converting is completed.
4. Margin support (Depends on Lib)

### Minor Features
1. Add to Path Ability
2. Local Build Option (CX freeze)

## Concern about venv on Github

There were a number of debate within me regarding the development of the project on venv and adding them to github together.

I later on decided not to add the venv environment on Github. Instead, I will have to create a new requirements file regarding the project
